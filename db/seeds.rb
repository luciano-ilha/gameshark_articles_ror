# Article.create(title: 'The Last of Us Part II Is a Dark Game for a Dark Time', text: 'At the climax of The Last of Us, a blockbuster 2013 video game that is superficially about a zombie-fungus apocalypse but is really about the lengths a parent will go to protect a child, you are forced to kill a doctor. This doctor is not a threat. He stands there limply, holding a scalpel, so technically he’s not unarmed — but you’ve got a gun and the gameplay has made it clear, after hours of close fighting, that your character could subdue the man peacefully if he wanted.', user_id: 2, category_id: 1)
# Article.create(title: 'Why Uncharted 5 Should Change The Series Protagonist', text: 'It’s been widely suspected that Naughty Dog’s Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End is the long-running franchise’s final installment. The original Uncharted debuted in 2007, and the fourth game came out in 2016. But since then, even though an Uncharted movie is currently in the works, there’s been no word on if or when a fifth game could be happening. Since the games usually release in 2-5 years of each other, it doesn’t bode well that there’s been no news about another title.', user_id: 3, category_id: 2)
# Article.create(title: 'PES 2021 Season Update Review', text: "You see, while Konami chips away at its vision for next-gen football arriving next year, PES 2021 arrives as an unapologetic stop-gap release, priced significantly lower than usual (including an additional 20% discount for PES 2020 owners) and offering distinctly fewer new features than you’d expect, even for a franchise with such a relentless annualised release cadence. The graphics? They’re the same. Controls? They're the same too. Menus? Okay, there are some new background pictures, but you can see what I’m trying to say. This is, in no uncertain terms, a collection of updated squads, kits, and whatever Paul Pogba’s latest misadventure with peroxide might be.", user_id: 4, category_id: 3)

The Warzone subway metro stations are probably the biggest game-changer but there are also new operators, guns, and an Armored Royale LTM where you drive around the map in a massive truck. Coming up we've got the biggest Warzone Season 6 changes that have arrived with the update.", user_id: 5, category_id: 4)

Diablo 4 had been an open secret for years despite the speedbump that was the Diablo Immortal announcement at BlizzCon 2018.
